## Project Description
The Unit 12 mySQL Management Query project is a node.js command line project to create a query for a Manager to gather and change information for their company.  I used node.js to start the inquirer list of questions.  The User prompts what they would like to do, View All Employees, Departments or Roles.  The User can also Add a Department, Role or another Employee.

## Run the Project
The query is ran through node.js with node index.js or npm start to run the prompt questions.  Each prompt has a JavaScript function to run the mySQL queries to obtain the User wanted information.
